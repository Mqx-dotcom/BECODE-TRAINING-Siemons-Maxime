# The INTERNET:
    
**Internet is a Wire**

> a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.

Computers are **connected** to this wire, so they can **communicate**.
webpages are files that are on those server's hard drive
<br />

## SERVERS:
A **server** is a *special computer* connected directly to the Internet
Every server has **unique** internet protocol adress = IP
=> help to find each other
<br />
**Webpages** are files that are on those server's hard drive

##  ISP:
Internet provider, permit client to reach & communicates on the Internet

### IP:
formated as "0.0.0.0" 
named as **domain name** => google.com

**Computer**: client connected indirectly to the internet though a provider
*Need to use ISP to reach internet as an intermediary*

#### Router:
used as intermediare; 
direct your packet to the interneet 
eg : visiting "google.com" use multiple routers to reach the destination
=> help packets to reach the correct adress

<br />

Request: PC => router => internet (though ISP) => router => Server (google.com)
Answer : Server (google.com) => router => internet => router => pc

> Router **wraps** & **unwrap** a layer to discover where to send the packet next until it reach destination (your computer)

# So how does..:

## the packet reach the right path ?
#### IP adress
every equipement connected to the internet have an IP ADRESS to be identified

## the information travel through the internet :

Computer break info in smaller pieces : PACKETS
when info reach dest => reassemble packets to "build" files/img/infomations


# Internet as a graph
